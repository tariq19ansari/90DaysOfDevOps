# Task 1: **Understanding OSI & TCP/IP Models**

## Overview- 
- The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) and TCP/IP models are the backbone of networking. They help us understand how devices communicate and data flows across networks. Let’s break them down layer by layer, with examples to make it relatable.

## OSI Model Layers Explained- 
- The OSI Model consists of **7 layers**, each with a specific role in network communication. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Application Layer (Layer 7)**
-
- **Purpose**: The Application Layer is the topmost layer in the OSI model. It is responsible for direct communication between users and network applications like email, web browsing, and file transfers. This layer ensures that the data generated by software applications is properly formatted and sent over the network.
- **Common Protocols Used**:
   - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) → For sending emails.
   - FTP (File Transfer Protocol) → For transferring files between computers.
   - DNS (Domain Name System) → Converts website names (like google.com) into IP addresses.

- **Key Functions of the Application Layer**:
🔹 **Network Virtual Terminal (NVT)**– Remote Login: Allows a user to log into another computer remotely. 
_ *Example*: Using Telnet or SSH to access a server from another location.

    🔹 **File Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM)** – File Sharing: Enables users to access, retrieve, and manage files on a remote computer.
    _ *Example*: Downloading or uploading files using FTP.

    🔹 **Mail Services** – Email Communication: Supports email sending and receiving.
    _ *Example*: Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo Mail use SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 for email services.

    🔹 **Directory Services** – Information Lookup : Provides a database of network resources and services.
    _ *Example*: DNS (Domain Name System) helps convert website names (like facebook.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) so your browser can load the website.

- **Real-World Example**:
   - ✉️ Sending an Email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
   - 1️⃣ You write an email and press "Send" → Application Layer uses SMTP to send it.
   - 2️⃣ The email travels through different OSI layers and reaches the receiver.
   - 3️⃣ The receiver opens their email app → Application Layer uses POP3 or IMAP to display the email.
   
**2. Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**
- 
- **Purpose**: The Presentation Layer is responsible for formatting, translating, encrypting, and compressing data so it can be transmitted and understood properly. It ensures that data sent by an application is readable by the receiving system.

- **Protocols Used**:
   - JPEG, GIF, MPEG → Used for images and videos.
   - TLS/SSL (Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer) → Used for encrypting web data (HTTPS).

- **Key Functions of the Presentation Layer**:
    🔹 Translation (Data Conversion): Converts data formats so different systems can understand them.
    _ *Example*: If one system uses ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and another uses EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code), this layer ensures they can communicate.

    🔹 Encryption & Decryption (Security): Encrypts data before sending to keep it safe from hackers. Decrypts received data so the receiver can read it.
    _ *Example*: When you enter your password on a website, it is encrypted using TLS/SSL so no one can steal it. 
    
    🔹Compression (Efficient Transmission): Reduces file size for faster transmission and less bandwidth usage.
    _ *Example*: When you send a photo over WhatsApp, it gets compressed to load quickly without using too much internet data.   

- **Real-World Example**:
   - 📸 Sending a Photo via WhatsApp
   - 1️⃣ You send a high-quality image → Presentation Layer compresses it.
   - 2️⃣ WhatsApp encrypts the image for security.
   - 3️⃣ The receiver's phone decrypts and converts it into a viewable format.
   

**3. Session Layer (Layer 5)**
- 
- **Purpose**: The Session Layer is responsible for starting, managing, and ending communication (sessions) between two devices. It ensures that a connection is maintained during data transfer and closes it properly when done.
   
- **Protocols used**:
   1. NetBIOS – Used for communication in local networks.
   2. PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) – Used for VPN connections.

- **Key Functions of the Session Layer**:
    🔹 **Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination**: Starts, maintains, and ends communication between devices.
    _ *Example*: When you log into a website, your session stays active until you log out.

    🔹 **Synchronization (Checkpoints)**: Adds checkpoints to keep track of data transmission. If there’s a failure, the session can resume from the last checkpoint instead of restarting.
    _ *Example*: While downloading a large file, if the connection breaks, the download resumes from where it left off instead of restarting.
    
    🔹 **Dialog Controller (Communication Mode)**: Manages whether communication is one-way (simplex), two-way (half-duplex), or both ways simultaneously (full-duplex).
    _ *Example*: Simplex – TV broadcasting (one-way) // Half-Duplex – Walkie-talkie (one person talks at a time) // Full-Duplex Phone call (both can talk at the same time).

- **Real-World Example**:
   - 📩 Messenger App Communication (WhatsApp, Telegram, etc.)
   - 1️⃣ User types a message in a chat app → The session starts.
   - 2️⃣ Message is sent over the internet → The session is maintained.
   - 3️⃣ Message is received, and the user logs out → The session ends.
  
**4. Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
-
- **Purpose**: The Transport Layer ensures end-to-end data delivery and makes sure that data reaches the right application without errors or loss. It also breaks large messages into smaller segments for easier transmission.

- **At this layer, data is called a "Segment."**
**- Protocols used**:
   1.TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – Reliable, used for emails, web browsing, etc.
   2.UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – Faster, used for video calls, gaming, etc.

- **Key Functions of the Transport Layer**:
    🔹 **Segmentation and Reassembly**: Breaks large data into smaller chunks (segments). At the receiver’s end, it reassembles the segments in the correct order.
    _ *Example*: Like splitting a large book into multiple chapters and then combining them back to read smoothly.

    🔹 **Service Point Addressing (Port Numbers)**: Each segment has a port number to reach the correct application.
    _ *Example*: When opening a website, data goes to port 80 (HTTP) or port 443 (HTTPS). Email (SMTP) → Port 25, Video Call (VoIP) → Port 5060

    🔹 Error Control & Acknowledgment:If data is lost or incorrect, it is resent.
    _ *Example*: Like reordering a lost package from an online store.


**5. Network Layer (Layer 3)**
-
- **Purpose**: The Network Layer is responsible for sending data between devices in different networks. It ensures that data takes the best possible route to reach its destination.

- **Think of it like GPS navigation**: When you travel from one city to another, GPS finds the shortest and best route. Similarly, the Network Layer finds the best path for data to travel across networks.

- **Key Functions of the Network Layer**:
    🔹 **Routing**: Finds the best path for data to travel from the sender to the receiver.
    _ *Example*: Like Google Maps finding the fastest way to your destination.

    🔹 **Logical Addressing (IP Addressing)**: Assigns a unique IP address to every device on a network.
    *Example*: Just like every house has a unique postal address, every device has an IP address so data can reach the correct destination.


**6. Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**
-
- **Purpose**: The Data Link Layer (DLL) is responsible for node-to-node data transfer and error-free communication over the Physical Layer. It ensures that data reaches the correct device using its MAC address.

- **Devices in the Data Link Layer**:
    *- Switches* : (smart traffic controllers that send data to the correct device)
    *- Bridges* : (connect two networks and ensure smooth data transfer)

- **Two Sub-Layers of the Data Link Layer**:
   1.**Logical Link Control**(LLC) - Helps manage communication between devices.
   2.**Media Access Control**(MAC) - Uses MAC addresses to send data to the correct device.

- **How does it find the MAC address?** Uses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to ask, “Who owns this IP address?” The correct device responds with its MAC address, and data is sent.

- **Key Functions of the Data Link Layer**:
    🔹 **Framing**: Breaks data into frames (small data units) for transmission.
    _ *Example*: Like putting pages into an envelope before sending them in the mail.

    🔹 **Physical Addressing (MAC Addressing)**: Adds the sender’s & receiver’s MAC address to each frame.
    _ *Example*: Like writing both To and From addresses on an envelope.

    🔹 **Error Control**: Detects and resends lost or damaged frames.
    _ *Example*: Like a post office returning a damaged parcel so it can be resent.

    🔹 **Flow Control**: Ensures data is sent at the right speed so it doesn’t overload the receiver.
    _ *Example*: Like speaking slowly to someone who is writing down everything you say.

    🔹 **Access Control**: Decides which device can use the communication channel at a given time.
    _ *Example*: Like taking turns while speaking in a group discussion.
    
**7. Physical Layer (Layer 1)**
=
- **Purpose**: The Physical Layer is the first and lowest layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for the actual physical connection between devices and transmits data in the form of bits (0s and 1s). This layer deals with cables, signals, and hardware devices like hubs, repeaters, and modems.

- **Key Functions of the Physical Layer**:
🔹 **Bit Synchronization**: Ensures that sender and receiver are synchronized using a clock.
    _ *Example*: Think of a school bell—when it rings, students know when to start and stop.

    🔹**Bit Rate Control**: Defines the speed of data transmission (bits per second).
    _ *Example*: Like internet speed—some connections are fast (fiber-optic), while others are slow (dial-up).

    🔹**Physical Topologies**: Determines how devices are arranged in a network.
    _ **Types**:
   1. Bus Topology: Like a single road where all cars (devices) travel in one direction.
   2. Star Topology: Like a fan, where all blades (devices) connect to a central hub.
   3. Mesh Topology: Like a spider web, where every device is interconnected.

    🔹**Transmission Modes**: Defines how data moves between devices.
   _ **Types**:
   1. Simplex: Data flows in one direction only (like a radio station).
   2. Half-Duplex: Data flows both ways, but only one direction at a time (like a walkie-talkie).
   3. Full-Duplex: Data flows in both directions at the same time (like a phone call).

- The TCP/IP Model simplifies the OSI model into **4 layers**:

**1. Application Layer**
   - Combines OSI’s Application, Presentation, and Session layers.
   - Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.

**2. Transport Layer**
   - Same as OSI’s Transport Layer.
   - Protocols: TCP, UDP.

**3. Internet Layer**
   - Maps to OSI’s Network Layer.
   - Protocols: IP, ICMP.

**4. Network Access Layer**
   - Combines OSI’s Data Link and Physical Layers.
   - Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
   
**Real-World Scenario**: 
**Imagine sending an email**:
   1. **Application Layer**: You write the email and hit send.
   2. **Transport Layer**: TCP ensures the email is broken into packets and delivered reliably.
   3. **Network Layer**: IP routes the packets through the internet.
   4. **Data Link & Physical Layers**: Ethernet or Wi-Fi transfers the packets to your router and beyond.
